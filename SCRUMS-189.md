## Introduction  
Jenkins is a widely used open-source automation server that supports building, testing, and deploying applications. However, a single Jenkins instance can become a single point of failure (SPOF), leading to downtime and disruptions in CI/CD pipelines. High Availability (HA) ensures that Jenkins remains operational even if one instance fails by distributing workloads across multiple nodes.  

This documentation explains how to set up Jenkins HA, its benefits, best practices, and workflow.

## What is Jenkins HA?  
Jenkins High Availability (HA) refers to a setup where multiple Jenkins instances (master/controller nodes) work together to ensure continuous service availability. If the primary node fails, a secondary node takes over, minimizing downtime.  

Key components:  
- **Primary/Active Node** – Handles all Jenkins operations.  
- **Secondary/Standby Node(s)** – Takes over if the primary fails.  
- **Shared Storage** – Stores Jenkins configurations, jobs, and logs (e.g., NFS, EFS, S3).  
- **Load Balancer** – Distributes traffic across nodes (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy).

## Why Implement Jenkins HA?  
- **Minimize Downtime** – Avoid disruptions in CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Fault Tolerance** – Automatic failover in case of node failure.  
- **Scalability** – Distribute workload across multiple nodes.  
- **Disaster Recovery** – Ensures business continuity.

1. Clients send requests to the Load Balancer.  
2. The Load Balancer routes traffic to the active Jenkins node.  
3. Jenkins nodes share configurations and jobs via shared storage.  
4. If the primary node fails, the secondary node takes over.

## Advantages of Jenkins HA  
**Zero Downtime** – Seamless failover ensures continuous operations.  
**Improved Reliability** – Reduces risks of single-node failures.  
**Scalability** – Supports growing workloads.  
**Automated Recovery** – Self-healing mechanism.  

---

## Best Practices  
1. **Use Shared Storage** – Ensure `/var/lib/jenkins` is synchronized.  
2. **Automate Failover** – Use tools like **Keepalived** or Kubernetes for automatic switching.  
3. **Monitor Nodes** – Implement health checks (Prometheus, Grafana).  
4. **Backup Regularly** – Use plugins like **ThinBackup** or cloud storage.  
5. **Use Containers/Orchestration** – Deploy Jenkins on Kubernetes for dynamic scaling.  
6. **Test Failover** – Simulate failures to ensure reliability.  

---

## Conclusion  
Jenkins HA is essential for mission-critical CI/CD pipelines. By implementing a multi-node setup with shared storage and automated failover, organizations can ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. Follow best practices to maintain a robust Jenkins infrastructure.
